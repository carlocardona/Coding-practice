  ### Instructions

  * Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:

  ```
  var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
  ```

  * Then check if the first letter in the animal's name begins with a "c" or "o". If it does, create an alert saying, "Starts with 'c' or 'o'!"

  * **HINT:** You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element of an array.
              use => .charAt(0)

Pseudo Code:

my array of animals is here 

for the entire length of the variable

  if first letter is a "c" or an "o"
    do this if statement and alert user
